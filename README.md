## Details

You can check the final result [here](https://kevinaryeldev.vercel.app/)

This react project was created using vite. Other libraries added to the project so far were react-icons and styled-components.

I tend to use in this case the minimum possible amount of resources and external elements to create an webpage that i feel comfortable sharing the code with others.
Of course i want to show my skills in various react libraries and so on, but i feel this is not the space - some features will just appear obnoxious and superfluous.
